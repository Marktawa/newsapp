Sher Bahadur Deuba was sworn in on Tuesday evening as prime minister of Nepal, after hours of delay following controversy over the statement from the Office of the President on the appointment of the Nepali Congress leader.

Earlier in the day, President Bidya Devi Bhandari had appointed Deuba as prime minister, in line with Monday’s Supreme Court verdict.

The oath ceremony was initially scheduled for 6pm, but it was delayed after the Congress party took exception to the Office of the President’s statement that did not mention the constitutional provision under which Deuba was appointed the prime minister.
